            Here at Wdlytics we keep track of several economic, business, and social factors that can affect the future price of natural resources such as wood, oil, and varous metals. We analyze those factors and figure out the efect they would have using prediction algorithims and past data to give our customers a higly accurate estimate of what their good could be sold for in the future so as to allow them to negotiate for a more valuable price in their futures contract.
